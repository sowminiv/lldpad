.SH NAME
dcbtool \- manage the Data Center Bridging (DCB) settings of a DCB interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dcbtool -h
.br
.B dcbtool -v
.br
.B dcbtool [-rR]
.br
.BI "dcbtool [-rR] [" "command" "] [" "command arguments" "]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dcbtool
is used to query and set the DCB settings of a
DCB capable Ethernet interface.  It connects to the client interface
of
.B lldpad
to perform these operations.
.B dcbtool
will operate in interactive mode if it is executed without a 
.I command.
In interactive mode,
.B dcbtool
also functions as an event listener and will print out events
received from
.B lldpad
as they arrive.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
show the
.B dcbtool
usage message
.TP
.B \-v
shows
.B dcbtool
version information
.TP
.B \-r
display the raw
.B lldpad
client interface messages as well as the readable output.
.TP
.B \-R
display only the raw
.B lldpad
client interface messages
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B help 
shows the dcbtool usage message
.TP
.B ping 
test command.
.B lldpad
responds with "PPONG" if the client interface is operational.
.TP
.B license
displays
.B dcbtool
license information
.TP
.B quit
exit from interactive mode

.PP
The following commands interact with
.B lldpad
to manage the daemon and DCB features on DCB capable interfaces.

.B dcbtool
general configuration commands:
.TP
.RB "<" "gc" "|" "go" ">" " dcbx"
get the configured or operational version of the DCB capabilities exchange
protocol.  If different, the configured version will take effect (and become
the operational version) after
.B lldpad
is restarted.
.TP
.BR "sc dcbx v:" "[" "1" "|" "2" "]"
set the version of the DCB capabilities exchange protocol which will be used
the next time
.B lldpad
is started.  Information about version 1 can be found at:
.br
<http://download.intel.com/technology/eedc/dcb_cep_spec.pdf>
Information about version 2 can be found at:
.br
<http://www.ieee802.org/1/files/public/docs2008/az-wadekar-dcbx-capability-exchange-discovery-protocol-1108-v1.01.pdf>
.PP
DCB per-interface commands:
.TP
\fBgc \fR<\fIifname\fR> <\fIfeature\fR>
get configuration of \fIfeature\fR on interface \fIifname\fR.
.TP
\fBgo \fR<\fIifname\fR> <\fIfeature\fR>
get operational status of \fIfeature\fR on interface \fIifname\fR.
.TP
\fBgp \fR<\fIifname\fR> <\fIfeature\fR>
get peer configuration of \fIfeature\fR on interface \fIifname\fR.
.TP
\fBsc \fR<\fIifname\fR> <\fIfeature\fR> <\fIargs\fR>
set the configuration of \fIfeature\fR on interface \fIifname\fR.
.PP
.I feature
may be one of the following:
.TP
.B dcb
DCB state of the port
.TP
.B pg
priority groups
.TP
.B pfc
priority flow control
.TP
\fBapp:\fR<\fIsubtype\fR>
application specific data
.TP
\fBll:\fR<\fIsubtype\fR>
logical link status
.PP
.I subtype
can be:
.TP
.BR "0" "|" "fcoe"
Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)
.PP
.I args
can include:
.TP
.BR "e:" "<" "0" "|" "1" ">"
controls feature enable
.TP
.BR "a:" "<" "0" "|" "1" ">"
controls whether the feature is advertised via DCBX to the peer
.TP
.BR "w:" "<" "0" "|" "1" ">"
controls whether the feature is willing to change its operational
configuration based on what is received from the peer
.TP
.RI "[" "feature specific args" "]"
arguments specific to a DCB feature

.PP
Feature specific arguments for
.BR "dcb" ":"
.TP
.BR "on" "|" "off"
enable or disable DCB for the interface.  The
.B go
and
.B gp
commands are not needed for the
.B dcb
feature.  Also, the
.RI "enable(" "e" "), advertise(" "a" ") and willing(" "w" ")"
arguments are not required.

.PP
Feature specific arguments for
.BR "pg" ":"
.TP
.BI "pgid:" "xxxxxxxx"
Priority group ID for the 8 priorities.  From left to right
(priorities 0-7),
.I x
is the corresponding priority group ID value, which
can be
.I 0-7
for priority groups with bandwidth allocations or
.I f
(priority group ID 15) for the unrestricted priority group.

.TP
.BI "pgpct:" "x" "," "x" "," "x" "," "x" "," "x" "," "x" "," "x" "," "x"
Priority group percentage of link bandwidth.  From left to right
(priority groups 0-7),
.I x
is the percentage of link bandwidth allocated
to the corresponding priority group.  The total bandwidth must equal 100%.

.TP
.BI "uppct:" "x" "," "x" "," "x" "," "x" "," "x" "," "x" "," "x" "," "x"
Priority percentage of priority group bandwidth.  From left to right
(priorities 0-7),
.I x
is the percentage of priority group bandwidth
allocated to the corresponding priority.  The sum of percentages for
priorities which belong to the same priority group must total 100% (except
for priority group 15).

.TP
.BI "strict:" "xxxxxxxx"
Strict priority setting.  From left to right (priorities 0-7),
.I x
.RB "is " "0" " or " "1" ".  " "1"
indicates that the priority may utilize all of the bandwidth allocated to
its priority group.

.TP
.BI "up2tc:" "xxxxxxxx"
Priority to traffic class mapping.  From left to right (priorities 0-7),
.I x
is the traffic class (0-7) to which the priority is mapped.

.PP
Feature specific arguments for
.BR "pfc" ":"
.TP
.BI "pfcup:" "xxxxxxxx"
Enable/disable priority flow control.  From left to right
(priorities 0-7),
.I x
.RB "is " "0" " or " "1" ".  " "1"
indicates that the corresponding priority is configured to transmit
priority pause.

.PP
Feature specific arguments for \fBapp:\fR<\fIsubtype\fR>:
.TP
.BI "appcfg:" "xx"
.I xx
is a hexadecimal value representing an 8 bit bitmap where
1 bits indicate the priorities which frames for the applications specified by
.I subtype
should use.  The lowest order bit maps to priority 0.

.PP
Feature specific arguments for \fBll:\fR<\fIsubtype\fR>:
.TP
\fBstatus:\fR[\fB0\fR|\fB1\fR]
For testing purposes, the logical link status may be set to 0 or 1.  This
setting is not persisted in the configuration file.

.SH EXAMPLES

.PP
Enable DCB on interface \fIeth2\fR
.PP
.B dcbtool sc eth2 dcb on

.PP
Assign priorites 0-3 to priority group 0, priorites 4-6 to priority group 1 and
priority 7 to the unrestricted priority.  Also, allocate 25% of link
bandwidth to priority group 0 and 75% to group 1.
.PP
.B dcbtool sc eth2 pg pgid:0000111f pgpct:25,75,0,0,0,0,0,0
