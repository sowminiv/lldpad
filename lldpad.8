.B lldpad [-h]
.B [-v]
.B [-d]
.B [-k]
.B [-s]
.BI "[-f" " filename" "]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Executes the LLDP protocol for supported network interfaces.  The list of TLVs currently supported are:
.TP
-
IEEE 802.1AB Mandatory TLVs
.TP
-
IEEE 802.1AB Basic Management TLVs
.TP
-
IEEE 802.3 Organizationally Specific TLVs
.TP
-
LLDP-MED Organizationally Specific TLVs
.TP
-
Data Center Bridging capabilities exchange protocol (DCBX) TLVs
.br
.PP
Capabilities of
.B lldpad
include:
.TP
-
Transmission of LLDP PDUs containing enabled TLVs from enabled ports.
.TP
-
Reception of LLDP PDUs from enabled ports.
.TP
-
Operation of the DCBX protocol for interfaces which support the DCB rtnetlink
interface.  This includes operation of the DCBX state machines above LLDP and
corresponding configuration of the DCB parameters of the network interface.
Supported DCB
features are: Extended Transmission Selection, Priority Flow Control and the
FCoE application.
.TP
-
Configuring the DCB settings of the network driver based on the
operation of DCBX.
.TP
-
Provides a multi-channel interface for client applications to query and
configure features.  Events are also generated on the client interface 
to inform clients of changes.  The lldpad package
includes two clients:  lldptool for general LLDP agent management and 
dcbtool for DCB management.
.PP

.B lldpad
supports the versions of the DCB capabilities exchange (DCBX) protocol described here:
.TP
version 1
<http://download.intel.com/technology/eedc/dcb_cep_spec.pdf>
.PP
and here:
.TP
version 2 - also known as CEE DCBX
<http://www.ieee802.org/1/files/public/docs2008/az-wadekar-dcbx-capability-exchange-discovery-protocol-1108-v1.01.pdf>
.PP
See
.B dcbtool
for information on how to configure which version of DCBX
.B lldpad
executes.

.SH OPTIONS
.B lldpad
has the following command line options:
.TP
.B \-h
show usage information
.TP
.BI "-f" " filename"
use the specified file as the configuration file instead of the default file:
/var/lib/lldpad/lldpad.conf
.B lldpad
expects the directory of the configuration file to exist, but if the
configuration file does not exist, then a default configuration file will
be created.  lldpad creates and maintains the contents of the configuration
file.  Configuration should be performed by using lldptool or dcbtool.
.TP
.B \-d
run lldpad as a daemon
.TP
.B \-v
show lldpad version
.TP
.B \-k
used to terminate the first instance of lldpad that was started
(e.g. from initrd).
Once lldpad -k has been invoked and lldpad has been restarted, subsequent
invocations of lldpad -k will not terminate lldpad.

.TP
.B \-s
remove lldpad state records from shared memory
